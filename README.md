# CSS `calc()` Issue in Flexbox

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function within CSS, specifically within flexbox layouts. The problem arises from attempting to use `calc()` to determine dimensions without a previously defined size, leading to unexpected results.

**Problem:** Incorrect usage of `calc()` can cause the flexbox item's dimensions to not be calculated as expected.

**Solution:** Ensure a defined width or height before using `calc()` to correctly calculate the remaining space.
